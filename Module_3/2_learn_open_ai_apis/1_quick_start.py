Quick Start Example – OpenAI API

This file provides a minimal, end-to-end example for interacting with
the OpenAI API using Python. It is intended for first-time users who
want to verify their setup and start sending prompts to an AI model
as quickly as possible.

The examples in this file demonstrate:
- Sending a simple question to the AI
- Performing text classification
- Generating structured or creative content
- Extracting structured information from 2_unstructured text
- Running the program in an interactive prompt mode
